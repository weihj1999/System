How to choose branch with git?

$ go get github.com/ncw/stressdisk 
$ cd ~/Code/Go/src/github.com/ncw/stressdisk 
$ git remote -v 
origin        https://github.com/ncw/stressdisk (fetch) 
origin        https://github.com/ncw/stressdisk (push) 
$ git branch 
* (no branch) 
  master 

The fix is easy though 

$ git checkout master 
M        stressdisk.go 
Switched to branch 'master' 

You can choose checkout different branch to specifiy different branch name
