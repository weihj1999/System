Git Prerequisites
yum install git
yum install git-review
yum install python-pip
yum install testrepository
yum install gitk
yum install pep8
Generate ssh public key
ssh-keygen -t ras -C "your_email@xx.xx.com"
Add key to git 

Prepare workstation
cd ~
mkdir -p devel/nova-es
cd devel/nova-es
git init

Set git config:
git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"
git config --global gitreview.username yourgerritusername
git config --list


Clone a repository
git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/<projectname>.git
cd <projectname>
git review -s
Notes: git review will using ssh to check if you can login 
Gerrit with you ssh key, in case ssh may not work. so we can 
use https

git remote add gerrit https://<username>@review.openstack.org/<umbrella repository name>/<repository name>.git
git review -s

Then we need build new branch and ensure it is update:
#git remote update
#git checkout master
#git pull --ff-only origin master

Note:
origin is a name we checked from the above command, example:
weihj1999@weihj-dev:~/devel/cinder-as/cinder$ git remote update
Fetching origin
Fetching gerrit

We can use origin or gerrit

Create a topic branch to hold your work and switch to it. If you are 
working on a blueprint, name your topic branch bp/BLUEPRINT where BLUEPRINT 
is the name of a blueprint in Launchpad (for example, bp/authentication). 
The general convention when working on bugs is to name the branch 
bug/BUG-NUMBER (for example, bug/1234567). Otherwise, give it a meaningful 
name because it will show up as the topic for your change in Gerrit:

#git checkout -b TOPIC-BRANCH


How to work with bugs:
1. Confirm new bugs: When a bug is filed, it is set to the “New” status. A 
“New” bug can be marked “Confirmed” once it has been reproduced and is
 thus confirmed as genuine.
2. Solve inconsistencies: Make sure bugs are Confirmed, and if assigned that 
they are marked “In Progress”
3. Review incomplete bugs: See if information that caused them to be marked 
“Incomplete” has been provided, determine if more information is required
 and provide reminders to the bug reporter if they haven’t responded after 
 2-4 weeks.
4. Review stale In Progress bugs: Work with assignee of bugs to determine if 
the bug is still being worked on, if not, unassign them and mark them back 
to Confirmed or Triaged.
