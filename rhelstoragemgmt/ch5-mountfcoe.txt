RHEL 7 Online Storage Management

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important Warning
Online storage reconfiguration must be done carefully. System failures 
or interruptions during the process can lead to unexpected results. Red 
Hat advises that you reduce system load to the maximum extent possible 
during the change operations. This will reduce the chance of I/O errors, 
out-of-memory errors, or similar errors occurring in the midst of a 
configuration change. The following sections provide more specific 
guidelines regarding this.

In addition, Red Hat recommends that you back up all data before 
reconfiguring online storage.

5. Configuring an FCoE interface to automatically mount at boot

Note:

The instructions in this section are available in 
/usr/share/doc/fcoe-utils-version/README as of RHEL6.1

You can mount newly discovered disks via udev rules, autofs, and 
other similar methods. Sometimes, however, a specific service 
might require the FCoE disk to be mounted at boot-time. In such 
cases, the FCoE disk should be mounted as soon as the fcoe 
service runs and before the initiation of any service that 
requires the FCoE disk.

To configure an FCoE disk to automatically mount at boot, add 
proper FCoE mounting code to the startup script for the fcoe 
service. The fcoe startup script is /etc/init.d/fcoe.

The FCoE mounting code is different per system configuration, 
whether you are using a simple formatted FCoE disk, LVM, or 
multipathed device node.

The following is a sample FCoE mounting code for mounting file 
systems specified via wild cards in /etc/fstab:

mount_fcoe_disks_from_fstab()
{
    local timeout=20
	  local done=1
	  local fcoe_disks=($(egrep 'by-path\/fc-.*_netdev' /etc/fstab | cut -d ' ' -f1))

	  test -z $fcoe_disks && return 0
 
    echo -n "Waiting for fcoe disks . "
	  while [ $timeout -gt 0 ]; do
for disk in ${fcoe_disks[*]}; do
if ! test -b $disk; then
done=0
break
fi
done

test $done -eq 1 && break;
sleep 1
echo -n ". "
done=1
let timeout--
    done

    if test $timeout -eq 0; then
echo "timeout!"
    else
echo "done!"
	    fi

	    # mount any newly discovered disk
	    mount -a 2>/dev/null
}

The mount_fcoe_disks_from_fstab function should be invoked after 
the fcoe service script starts the fcoemon daemon. This will 
mount FCoE disks specified by the following paths in /etc/fstab:

/dev/disk/by-path/fc-0xXX:0xXX /mnt/fcoe-disk1 ext3  defaults,_netdev    0 0
/dev/disk/by-path/fc-0xYY:0xYY /mnt/fcoe-disk2 ext3  defaults,_netdev    0 0

Entries with fc- and _netdev sub-strings enable the mount_fcoe_disks_from_fstab 
function to identify FCoE disk mount entries. For more 
information on /etc/fstab entries, refer to man 5 fstab.

Note:
The fcoe service does not implement a timeout for FCoE disk 
discovery. As such, the FCoE mounting code should implement its 
own timeout period.
