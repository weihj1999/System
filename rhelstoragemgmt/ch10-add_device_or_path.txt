RHEL 7 Online Storage Management

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important Warning
Online storage reconfiguration must be done carefully. System failures
or interruptions during the process can lead to unexpected results. Red
Hat advises that you reduce system load to the maximum extent possible
during the change operations. This will reduce the chance of I/O errors,
out-of-memory errors, or similar errors occurring in the midst of a
configuration change. The following sections provide more specific
guidelines regarding this.

In addition, Red Hat recommends that you back up all data before
reconfiguring online storage.

10. Adding a storage device or path

When adding a device, be aware that the path-based device name 
(/dev/sd name, major:minor number, and /dev/disk/by-path name, 
for example) the system assigns to the new device may have been 
previously in use by a device that has since been removed. As such, 
ensure that all old references to the path-based device name have 
been removed. Otherwise, the new device may be mistaken for the 
old device.

Add a storage device or path

  1. The first step in adding a storage device or path is to 
  physically enable access to the new storage device, or a new 
  path to an existing device. This is done using vendor-specific 
  commands at the Fibre Channel or iSCSI storage server. When 
  doing so, note the LUN value for the new storage that will be 
  presented to your host. If the storage server is Fibre Channel, 
  also take note of the World Wide Node Name (WWNN) of the storage 
  server, and determine whether there is a single WWNN for all 
  ports on the storage server. If this is not the case, note the 
  World Wide Port Name (WWPN) for each port that will be used to 
  access the new LUN.
  
  2. Next, make the operating system aware of the new storage 
  device, or path to an existing device. The recommended command 
  to use is:

  $ echo "c t l" >  /sys/class/scsi_host/hosth/scan
  
  In the previous command, h is the HBA number, c is the channel 
  on the HBA, t is the SCSI target ID, and l is the LUN.
NOTE
The older form of this command, 
echo "scsi add-single-device 0 0 0 0" > /proc/scsi/scsi, 
is deprecated.

  a. In some Fibre Channel hardware, a newly created LUN on the 
  RAID array may not be visible to the operating system until a 
  Loop Initialization Protocol (LIP) operation is performed. 
  Refer to Section ch11, “Scanning Storage Interconnects” for 
  instructions on how to do this.
  IMPORTANT
  It will be necessary to stop I/O while this operation is executed 
  if an LIP is required.
  
  b. If a new LUN has been added on the RAID array but is still 
  not being configured by the operating system, confirm the list
  of LUNs being exported by the array using the sg_luns command, 
  part of the sg3_utils package. This will issue the "SCSI REPORT LUNS" 
  command to the RAID array and return a list of LUNs that are 
  present.

For Fibre Channel storage servers that implement a single WWNN 
for all ports, you can determine the correct h,c,and t values 
(i.e. HBA number, HBA channel, and SCSI target ID) by searching 
for the WWNN in sysfs.

Determin correct h, c, and t values

For example, if the WWNN of the storage server is 
0x5006016090203181, use:

$ grep 5006016090203181 /sys/class/fc_transport/*/node_name

This should display output similar to the following:
/sys/class/fc_transport/target5:0:2/node_name:0x5006016090203181 
/sys/class/fc_transport/target5:0:3/node_name:0x5006016090203181 
/sys/class/fc_transport/target6:0:2/node_name:0x5006016090203181 
/sys/class/fc_transport/target6:0:3/node_name:0x5006016090203181

This indicates there are four Fibre Channel routes to this target 
(two single-channel HBAs, each leading to two storage ports). 
Assuming a LUN value is 56, then the following command will 
configure the first path:

$ echo "0 2 56" >  /sys/class/scsi_host/host5/scan

This must be done for each path to the new device.

For Fibre Channel storage servers that do not implement a single 
WWNN for all ports, you can determine the correct HBA number, 
HBA channel, and SCSI target ID by searching for each of the WWPNs 
in sysfs.

Another way to determine the HBA number, HBA channel, and SCSI 
target ID is to refer to another device that is already configured 
on the same path as the new device. This can be done with various 
commands, such as lsscsi, scsi_id, multipath -l, and ls -l /dev/disk/by-*. 
This information, plus the LUN number of the new device, can be 
used as shown above to probe and configure that path to the new 
device.

  3. After adding all the SCSI paths to the device, execute the 
  multipath command, and check to see that the device has been 
  properly configured. At this point, the device can be added to 
  md, LVM, mkfs, or mount, for example.

If the steps above are followed, then a device can safely be added 
to a running system. It is not necessary to stop I/O to other 
devices while this is done. Other procedures involving a rescan 
(or a reset) of the SCSI bus, which cause the operating system to 
update its state to reflect the current device connectivity, are 
not recommended while storage I/O is in progress.
