RHEL 7 Online Storage Management

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important Warning
Online storage reconfiguration must be done carefully. System failures 
or interruptions during the process can lead to unexpected results. Red 
Hat advises that you reduce system load to the maximum extent possible 
during the change operations. This will reduce the chance of I/O errors, 
out-of-memory errors, or similar errors occurring in the midst of a 
configuration change. The following sections provide more specific 
guidelines regarding this.

In addition, Red Hat recommends that you back up all data before 
reconfiguring online storage.

2. Create an iSCSI initiator

After creating a target with targetcli as in Ch1“Target Setup” use the 
iscsiadm utility to set up an initiator.

Note:
  In RHEL7, the iSCSI service is lazily started by default. That is, 
  should an iscsiadm command be issued the service will start.
  
Create an iSCSI initiator

1. Install iscsi-initiator-utils
# yum install iscsi-initiator-utils

2. If a custom name was given to the aCL in CH1.6,  then thcnage the 
/etc/iscsi/initiatorname.isci file to match

#vim /etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi
#cat /etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi
InitiatorName=iqn.2006-04.com.example.foo

3. Discover the target
# iscsiadm -m discovery -t st -p target-ip-address
10.64.24.179:3260,1 iqn.2006-04.com.example:3260

4. Log in to the target with the target iqn name found in the 
above step.

#iscsiadm -m node -T iqn.2006-04.com.example:3260 -l
Logging in to [iface: default, target: iqn.2006-04.com.example:3260, portal: 
10.64.24.179,3260] (multiple)
Login to [iface: default, target: iqn.2006-04.com.example:3260, portal: 
10.64.24.179,3260] successful.

This procedure can be followed for any number of initators 
connected to the same LUN so long as their specific initiator 
names are added to the ACL as described in ch1.6
