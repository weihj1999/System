RHEL 7 Online Storage Management

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important Warning
Online storage reconfiguration must be done carefully. System failures
or interruptions during the process can lead to unexpected results. Red
Hat advises that you reduce system load to the maximum extent possible
during the change operations. This will reduce the chance of I/O errors,
out-of-memory errors, or similar errors occurring in the midst of a
configuration change. The following sections provide more specific
guidelines regarding this.

In addition, Red Hat recommends that you back up all data before
reconfiguring online storage.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

16. RESIZING AN ONLINE LOGICAL UNIT

In most cases, fully resizing an online logical unit involves two 
things: resizing the logical unit itself and reflecting the size 
change in the corresponding multipath device (if multipathing is 
enabled on the system).

To resize the online logical unit, start by modifying the logical 
unit size through the array management interface of your storage 
device. This procedure differs with each array; as such, consult 
your storage array vendor documentation for more information on 
this.

NOTE
In order to resize an online file system, the file system must 
not reside on a partitioned device.

16.1. Resizing Fibre Channel Logical Units

After modifying the online logical unit size, re-scan the logical 
unit to ensure that the system detects the updated size. To do 
this for Fibre Channel logical units, use the following command:

$ echo 1 > /sys/block/sdX/device/rescan

IMPORTANT
To re-scan Fibre Channel logical units on a system that uses 
multipathing, execute the aforementioned command for each sd 
device (i.e. sd1, sd2, and so on) that represents a path for the 
multipathed logical unit. To determine which devices are paths 
for a multipath logical unit, use multipath -ll; then, find the 
entry that matches the logical unit being resized. It is advisable 
that you refer to the WWID of each entry to make it easier to 
find which one matches the logical unit being resized.

16.2. Resizing an iSCSI Logical Unit

After modifying the online logical unit size, re-scan the logical 
unit to ensure that the system detects the updated size. To do 
this for iSCSI devices, use the following command:

# iscsiadm -m node --targetname target_name -R


Replace target_name with the name of the target where the device 
is located.
NOTE
You can also re-scan iSCSI logical units using the following command:

# iscsiadm -m node -R -I interface

Replace interface with the corresponding interface name of the 
resized logical unit (for example, iface0). This command performs 
two operations:

It scans for new devices in the same way that the command 
echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/host/scan does 

(refer to Section ch14, “Scanning iSCSI Interconnects”).

It re-scans for new/modified logical units the same way that the 
command 

echo 1 > /sys/block/sdX/device/rescan 

does. Note that this command is the same one used for re-scanning 
Fibre Channel logical units.

16.3. Updating the Size of Your Multipath Device

If multipathing is enabled on your system, you will also need to 
reflect the change in logical unit size to the logical unit's 
corresponding multipath device (after resizing the logical unit). 
This can be done through multipathd. To do so, first ensure that 
multipathd is running using service multipathd status. Once you've 
verified that multipathd is operational, run the following command:

# multipathd -k"resize map multipath_device"

The multipath_device variable is the corresponding multipath entry 
of your device in /dev/mapper. Depending on how multipathing is 
set up on your system, multipath_device can be either of two 
formats:
  1. mpathX, 
  where X is the corresponding entry of your device 
  (for example, mpath0)
  2. a WWID; for example, 3600508b400105e210000900000490000

To determine which multipath entry corresponds to your resized 
logical unit, run multipath -ll. This displays a list of all 
existing multipath entries in the system, along with the major and minor numbers of their corresponding devices.

IMPORTANT
Do not use multipathd -k"resize map multipath_device" if there 
are any commands queued to multipath_device. That is, do not use 
this command when the no_path_retry parameter (in 
/etc/multipath.conf) is set to "queue", and there are no active 
paths to the device.

For more information about multipathing, refer to the RHEL 7 
DM Multipath guide.

16.4. Changing the Read/Write State of an Online Logical Unit

Certain storage devices provide the user with the ability to 
change the state of the device from Read/Write (R/W) to Read-Only 
(RO), and from RO to R/W. This is typically done through a 
management interface on the storage device. The operating system 
will not automatically update its view of the state of the device 
when a change is made. Follow the procedures described in this 
chapter to make the operating system aware of the change.

Run the following command, replacing XYZ with the desired device 
designator, to determine the operating system's current view of 
the R/W state of a device:

# blockdev --getro /dev/sdXYZ

The following command is also available for RHEL7:
# cat /sys/block/sdXYZ/ro 1 = read-only 0 = read-write

When using multipath, refer to the ro or rw field in the second 
line of output from the multipath -ll command. For example:

36001438005deb4710000500000640000 dm-8 GZ,GZ500
[size=20G][features=0][hwhandler=0][ro]
\_ round-robin 0 [prio=200][active]
 \_ 6:0:4:1  sdax 67:16  [active][ready]
 \_ 6:0:5:1  sday 67:32  [active][ready]
\_ round-robin 0 [prio=40][enabled]
 \_ 6:0:6:1  sdaz 67:48  [active][ready]
 \_ 6:0:7:1  sdba 67:64  [active][ready]

To change the R/W state, use the following procedure:

Procedure Change the R/W state

  1. To move the device from RO to R/W, see step 2.
  To move the device from R/W to RO, ensure no further writes will 
  be issued. Do this by stopping the application, or through the 
  use of an appropriate, application-specific action.
  
  Ensure that all outstanding write I/Os are complete with the 
  following command:
  
  # blockdev --flushbufs /dev/device
  
  Replace device with the desired designator; for a device mapper 
  multipath, this is the entry for your device in dev/mapper. For 
  example, /dev/mapper/mpath3.

  2. Use the management interface of the storage device to change 
  the state of the logical unit from R/W to RO, or from RO to R/W. 
  The procedure for this differs with each array. Consult applicable 
  storage array vendor documentation for more information.

  3. Perform a re-scan of the device to update the operating 
  system's view of the R/W state of the device. If using a device 
  mapper multipath, perform this re-scan for each path to the 
  device before issuing the command telling multipath to reload 
  its device maps.

	This process is explained in further detail in ch16.4.1, 
	“Rescanning logical units”.

16.4.1. Rescanning logical units

After modifying the online logical unit Read/Write state, as 
described in ch16.4, “Changing the Read/Write State of an Online 
Logical Unit”, re-scan the logical unit to ensure the system 
detects the updated state with the following command:

# echo 1 > /sys/block/sdX/device/rescan

To re-scan logical units on a system that uses multipathing, 
execute the above command for each sd device that represents a 
path for the multipathed logical unit. For example, run the 
command on sd1, sd2 and all other sd devices. To determine which 
devices are paths for a multipath unit, use multipath -11, then 
find the entry that matches the logical unit to be changed.

Use of the multipath -11 command

For example, the multipath -11 above shows the path for the LUN 
with WWID 36001438005deb4710000500000640000. In this case, enter:

# echo 1 > /sys/block/sdax/device/rescan
# echo 1 > /sys/block/sday/device/rescan
# echo 1 > /sys/block/sdaz/device/rescan
# echo 1 > /sys/block/sdba/device/rescan

16.4.2. Updating the R/W state of a multipath device

If multipathing is enabled, after rescanning the logical unit, 
the change in its state will need to be reflected in the logical 
unit's corresponding multipath drive. Do this by reloading the 
multipath device maps with the following command:

# multipath -r

The multipath -11 command can then be used to confirm the change.
