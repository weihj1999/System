RHEL 7 Online Storage Management

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important Warning
Online storage reconfiguration must be done carefully. System failures
or interruptions during the process can lead to unexpected results. Red
Hat advises that you reduce system load to the maximum extent possible
during the change operations. This will reduce the chance of I/O errors,
out-of-memory errors, or similar errors occurring in the midst of a
configuration change. The following sections provide more specific
guidelines regarding this.

In addition, Red Hat recommends that you back up all data before
reconfiguring online storage.

17. ADDING/REMOVING A LOGICAL UNIT THROUGH RESCAN-SCSI-BUS.SH

The sg3_utils package provides the rescan-scsi-bus.sh script, 
which can automatically update the logical unit configuration of 
the host as needed (after a device has been added to the system). 
The rescan-scsi-bus.sh script can also perform an issue_lip on 
supported devices. For more information about how to use this 
script, refer to rescan-scsi-bus.sh --help.

To install the sg3_utils package, run yum install sg3_utils.

Known Issues With rescan-scsi-bus.sh

When using the rescan-scsi-bus.sh script, take note of the 
following known issues:

  1. In order for rescan-scsi-bus.sh to work properly, LUN0 must 
  be the first mapped logical unit. The rescan-scsi-bus.sh can 
  only detect the first mapped logical unit if it is LUN0. The 
  rescan-scsi-bus.sh will not be able to scan any other logical 
  unit unless it detects the first mapped logical unit even if 
  you use the --nooptscan option.
  
  2. A race condition requires that rescan-scsi-bus.sh be run 
  twice if logical units are mapped for the first time. During 
  the first scan, rescan-scsi-bus.sh only adds LUN0; all other 
  logical units are added in the second scan.
  
  3. A bug in the rescan-scsi-bus.sh script incorrectly executes 
  the functionality for recognizing a change in logical unit size 
  when the --remove option is used.
  
  4. The rescan-scsi-bus.sh script does not recognize ISCSI logical
  unit removals.
