RHEL 7 Online Storage Management

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important Warning
Online storage reconfiguration must be done carefully. System failures
or interruptions during the process can lead to unexpected results. Red
Hat advises that you reduce system load to the maximum extent possible
during the change operations. This will reduce the chance of I/O errors,
out-of-memory errors, or similar errors occurring in the midst of a
configuration change. The following sections provide more specific
guidelines regarding this.

In addition, Red Hat recommends that you back up all data before
reconfiguring online storage.

18. MODIFYING LINK LOSS BEHAVIOR

25.18. MODIFYING LINK LOSS BEHAVIOR

This section describes how to modify the link loss behavior of 
devices that use either Fibre Channel or iSCSI protocols.

18.1. Fibre Channel

If a driver implements the Transport dev_loss_tmo callback, 
access attempts to a device through a link will be blocked when 
a transport problem is detected. To verify if a device is blocked, 
run the following command:

$ cat /sys/block/device/device/state

This command will return blocked if the device is blocked. If the 
device is operating normally, this command will return running.

Determining The State of a Remote Port

  1. To determine the state of a remote port, run the following 
  command:

$ cat
/sys/class/fc_remote_port/rport-H:B:R/port_state

  2. This command will return Blocked when the remote port (along 
  with devices accessed through it) are blocked. If the remote 
  port is operating normally, the command will return Online.
  
  3. If the problem is not resolved within dev_loss_tmo seconds, 
  the rport and devices will be unblocked and all I/O running on 
  that device (along with any new I/O sent to that device) will 
  be failed.
  
Changing dev_loss_tmo

To change the dev_loss_tmo value, echo in the desired value to 
the file. For example, to set dev_loss_tmo to 30 seconds, run:

$ echo 30 >
/sys/class/fc_remote_port/rport-H:B:R/dev_loss_tmo

For more information about dev_loss_tmo, refer to ch3.1, “Fibre 
Channel API”.

When a link loss exceeds dev_loss_tmo, the scsi_device and sdN 
devices are removed. Typically, the Fibre Channel class will 
leave the device as is; i.e. /dev/sdx will remain /dev/sdx. This 
is because the target binding is saved by the Fibre Channel driver 
so when the target port returns, the SCSI addresses are recreated 
faithfully. However, this cannot be guaranteed; the sdx will be 
restored only if no additional change on in-storage box configuration 
of LUNs is made.

18.2. iSCSI Settings With dm-multipath

If dm-multipath is implemented, it is advisable to set iSCSI 
timers to immediately defer commands to the multipath layer. To 
configure this, nest the following line under device { in 
/etc/multipath.conf:

features		"1 queue_if_no_path"

This ensures that I/O errors are retried and queued if all paths 
are failed in the dm-multipath layer.

You may need to adjust iSCSI timers further to better monitor 
your SAN for problems. Available iSCSI timers you can configure 
are NOP-Out Interval/Timeouts and replacement_timeout, which are 
discussed in the following sections.

18.2.1. NOP-Out Interval/Timeout

To help monitor problems the SAN, the iSCSI layer sends a NOP-Out 
request to each target. If a NOP-Out request times out, the iSCSI 
layer responds by failing any running commands and instructing 
the SCSI layer to requeue those commands when possible.

When dm-multipath is being used, the SCSI layer will fail those 
running commands and defer them to the multipath layer. The 
multipath layer then retries those commands on another path. If 
dm-multipath is not being used, those commands are retried five 
times before failing altogether.

Intervals between NOP-Out requests are 10 seconds by default. To 
adjust this, open /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf and edit the following 
line:

node.conn[0].timeo.noop_out_interval = [interval value]

Once set, the iSCSI layer will send a NOP-Out request to each 
target every [interval value] seconds.

By default, NOP-Out requests time out in 10 seconds. 
Note:
Prior to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4, the default NOP-Out requests 
time out was 15 seconds.

To adjust this, open /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf and edit the following 
line:

node.conn[0].timeo.noop_out_timeout = [timeout value]

This sets the iSCSI layer to timeout a NOP-Out request after 
[timeout value] seconds.

SCSI Error Handler

If the SCSI Error Handler is running, running commands on a path 
will not be failed immediately when a NOP-Out request times out 
on that path. Instead, those commands will be failed after 
replacement_timeout seconds. For more information about replacement_timeout, 
refer to ch18.2.2, “replacement_timeout”.

To verify if the SCSI Error Handler is running, run:

# iscsiadm -m session -P 3

18.2.2. replacement_timeout

replacement_timeout controls how long the iSCSI layer should wait 
for a timed-out path/session to reestablish itself before failing 
any commands on it. The default replacement_timeout value is 120 
seconds.

To adjust replacement_timeout, open /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf and 
edit the following line:

node.session.timeo.replacement_timeout = [replacement_timeout]

The 1 queue_if_no_path option in /etc/multipath.conf sets iSCSI 
timers to immediately defer commands to the multipath layer 
(refer to ch18.2, “iSCSI Settings With dm-multipath”). This 
setting prevents I/O errors from propagating to the application; 
because of this, you can set replacement_timeout to 15-20 seconds.

By configuring a lower replacement_timeout, I/O is quickly sent 
to a new path and executed (in the event of a NOP-Out timeout) 
while the iSCSI layer attempts to re-establish the failed path/session. 
If all paths time out, then the multipath and device mapper layer 
will internally queue I/O based on the settings in /etc/multipath.conf 
instead of /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf.

IMPORTANT
Whether your considerations are failover speed or security, the 
recommended value for replacement_timeout will depend on other 
factors. These factors include the network, target, and system 
workload. As such, it is recommended that you thoroughly test any 
new configurations to replacements_timeout before applying it to 
a mission-critical system.

18.3. iSCSI Root

When accessing the root partition directly through an iSCSI disk, 
the iSCSI timers should be set so that iSCSI layer has several 
chances to try to reestablish a path/session. In addition, commands 
should not be quickly re-queued to the SCSI layer. This is the 
opposite of what should be done when dm-multipath is implemented.

To start with, NOP-Outs should be disabled. You can do this by 
setting both NOP-Out interval and timeout to zero. To set this, 
open /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf and edit as follows:

node.conn[0].timeo.noop_out_interval = 0
node.conn[0].timeo.noop_out_timeout = 0

In line with this, replacement_timeout should be set to a high 
number. This will instruct the system to wait a long time for a 
path/session to reestablish itself. To adjust replacement_timeout, 
open /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf and edit the following line:

node.session.timeo.replacement_timeout = replacement_timeout

After configuring /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf, you must perform a 
re-discovery of the affected storage. This will allow the system 
to load and use any new values in /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf. For 
more information on how to discover iSCSI devices, refer to 
ch14, “Scanning iSCSI Interconnects”.

Configuring Timeouts for a Specific Session

You can also configure timeouts for a specific session and make 
them non-persistent (instead of using /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf). 
To do so, run the following command (replace the variables 
accordingly):

# iscsiadm -m node -T target_name -p target_IP:port -o update -n node.session.timeo.replacement_timeout -v $timeout_value

IMPORTANT
The configuration described here is recommended for iSCSI sessions 
involving root partition access. For iSCSI sessions involving 
access to other types of storage (namely, in systems that use 
dm-multipath), refer to ch18.2, “iSCSI Settings With dm-multipath”.
