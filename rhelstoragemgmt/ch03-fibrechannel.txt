RHEL 7 Online Storage Management

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important Warning
Online storage reconfiguration must be done carefully. System failures 
or interruptions during the process can lead to unexpected results. Red 
Hat advises that you reduce system load to the maximum extent possible 
during the change operations. This will reduce the chance of I/O errors, 
out-of-memory errors, or similar errors occurring in the midst of a 
configuration change. The following sections provide more specific 
guidelines regarding this.

In addition, Red Hat recommends that you back up all data before 
reconfiguring online storage.

3. Fibre Channel
This section discusses the Fibre Channel API, native rhel7 Fibre Channel 
drivers, and the Fibre Channel capabilities of these drivers.

3.1 Fibre Channel API
Below is a list of /sys/class/ directories that contain files used 
to provide the userspace API. In each item, host numbers are 
designated by H, bus numbers are B, targets are T, logical unit 
numbers (LUNs) are L, and remote port numbers are R.

Important
If your system is using multipath software, Red Hat recommends 
that you consult your hardware vendor before changing any of the 
values described in this section.

Transport: /sys/class/fc_transport/targetH:B:T/
port_id — 24-bit port ID/address
node_name — 64-bit node name
port_name — 64-bit port name

Remote Port: /sys/class/fc_remote_ports/rport-H:B-R/
port_id
node_name
port_name

dev_loss_tmo — number of seconds to wait before marking a link 
as "bad". Once a link is marked bad, I/O running on its 
corresponding path (along with any new I/O on that path) will be 
failed.

The default dev_loss_tmo value varies, depending on which driver/device 
is used. If a Qlogic adapter is used, the default is 35 seconds, 
while if an Emulex adapter is used, it is 30 seconds. The dev_loss_tmo 
value can be changed via the scsi_transport_fc module parameter 
dev_loss_tmo, although the driver can override this timeout value.

The maximum dev_loss_tmo value is 600 seconds. If dev_loss_tmo is 
set to zero or any value greater than 600, the driver's internal 
timeouts will be used instead.

fast_io_fail_tmo — length of time to wait before failing I/O 
executed when a link problem is detected. I/O that reaches the 
driver will fail. If I/O is in a blocked queue, it will not be failed 
until dev_loss_tmo expires and the queue is unblocked.

Host: /sys/class/fc_host/hostH/
port_id
issue_lip — instructs the driver to rediscover remote ports.
