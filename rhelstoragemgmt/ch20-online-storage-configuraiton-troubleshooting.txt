RHEL 7 Online Storage Management

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important Warning
Online storage reconfiguration must be done carefully. System failures
or interruptions during the process can lead to unexpected results. Red
Hat advises that you reduce system load to the maximum extent possible
during the change operations. This will reduce the chance of I/O errors,
out-of-memory errors, or similar errors occurring in the midst of a
configuration change. The following sections provide more specific
guidelines regarding this.

In addition, Red Hat recommends that you back up all data before
reconfiguring online storage.

20. 20. ONLINE STORAGE CONFIGURATION TROUBLESHOOTING

This section provides solution to common problems users experience 
during online storage reconfiguration.

Logical unit removal status is not reflected on the host.

  When a logical unit is deleted on a configured filer, the change 
  is not reflected on the host. In such cases, lvm commands will 
  hang indefinitely when dm-multipath is used, as the logical unit 
  has now become stale.
  
  To work around this, perform the following procedure:
  
  Working Around Stale Logical Units

  1. Determine which mpath link entries in /etc/lvm/cache/.cache 
  are specific to the stale logical unit. To do this, run the 
  following command:

  $ ls -l /dev/mpath | grep stale-logical-unit

  example: Determine specific mpath link entries

For example, if stale-logical-unit is 3600d0230003414f30000203a7bc41a00, 
the following results may appear:

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Aug  2 10:33 /3600d0230003414f30000203a7bc41a00 -> ../dm-4
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Aug  2 10:33 /3600d0230003414f30000203a7bc41a00p1 -> ../dm-5

This means that 3600d0230003414f30000203a7bc41a00 is mapped to 
two mpath links: dm-4 and dm-5.

Next, open /etc/lvm/cache/.cache. Delete all lines containing 
stale-logical-unit and the mpath links that stale-logical-unit 
maps to.

  example: Delete relevant lines

  Using the same example in the previous step, the lines you need 
  to delete are:
/dev/dm-4 
/dev/dm-5 
/dev/mapper/3600d0230003414f30000203a7bc41a00
/dev/mapper/3600d0230003414f30000203a7bc41a00p1
/dev/mpath/3600d0230003414f30000203a7bc41a00
/dev/mpath/3600d0230003414f30000203a7bc41a00p1
