RHEL 7 Online Storage Management

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important Warning
Online storage reconfiguration must be done carefully. System failures
or interruptions during the process can lead to unexpected results. Red
Hat advises that you reduce system load to the maximum extent possible
during the change operations. This will reduce the chance of I/O errors,
out-of-memory errors, or similar errors occurring in the midst of a
configuration change. The following sections provide more specific
guidelines regarding this.

In addition, Red Hat recommends that you back up all data before
reconfiguring online storage.

15. LOGGING IN TO AN ISCSI TARGET

As mentioned in ch6, “iSCSI”, the iSCSI service must be running 
in order to discover or log into targets. To start the iSCSI 
service, run:

# service iscsi start

When this command is executed, the iSCSI init scripts will 
automatically log into targets where the node.startup setting 
is configured as automatic. This is the default value of node.startup 
for all targets.

To prevent automatic login to a target, set node.startup to manual. 
To do this, run the following command:

# iscsiadm -m node --targetname proper_target_name -p target_IP:port -o update -n node.startup -v manual

Deleting the entire record will also prevent automatic login. 
To do this, run:

# iscsiadm -m node --targetname proper_target_name -p target_IP:port -o delete

To automatically mount a file system from an iSCSI device on the 
network, add a partition entry for the mount in /etc/fstab with the _netdev option. For example, to automatically mount the iSCSI device sdb to /mount/iscsi during startup, add the following line to /etc/fstab:

/dev/sdb /mnt/iscsi ext3 _netdev 0 0

To manually log in to an iSCSI target, use the following command:

# iscsiadm -m node --targetname proper_target_name -p target_IP:port -l

NOTE
The proper_target_name and target_IP:port refer to the full name 
and IP address/port combination of a target. For more information, 
refer to ch6.1, “iSCSI API” and ch14, “Scanning iSCSI Interconnects”.
