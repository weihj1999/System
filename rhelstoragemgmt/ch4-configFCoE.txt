RHEL 7 Online Storage Management

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important Warning
Online storage reconfiguration must be done carefully. System failures 
or interruptions during the process can lead to unexpected results. Red 
Hat advises that you reduce system load to the maximum extent possible 
during the change operations. This will reduce the chance of I/O errors, 
out-of-memory errors, or similar errors occurring in the midst of a 
configuration change. The following sections provide more specific 
guidelines regarding this.

In addition, Red Hat recommends that you back up all data before 
reconfiguring online storage.

4. Configuring a Fibre Channel over Ethernet interface

Setting up and deploying a Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) 
interface requires two packages:

  fcoe-utils
  lldpad

Once these packages are installed, perform the following procedure 
to enable FCoE over a virtual LAN (VLAN):

Configuring an Ethernet interface to use FCoE
  1. Configure a new VLAN by copying an existing network script 
  (e.g. /etc/fcoe/cfg-eth0) to the name of the Ethernet device 
  that supports FCoE. This will provide you with a default file 
  to configure. Given that the FCoE device is ethX, run:
  
  # cp /etc/fcoe/cfg-eth0  /etc/fcoe/cfg-ethX
  
  Modify the contents of cfg-ethX as necessary. Of note, 
  DCB_REQUIRED should be set to no for networking interfaces that 
  implement a hardware DCBX client.
  
  2. If you want the device to automatically load during boot time, 
  set ONBOOT=yes in the corresponding /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ethX 
  file. For example, if the FCoE device is eth2, then edit 
  /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth2 accordingly.
  
  3. Start the data center bridging daemon (dcbd) using the following 
  command:
  
  # /etc/init.d/lldpad start
  
  4. For networking interfaces that implement a hardware DCBX 
  client, skip this step and move on to the next.
  
  For interfaces that require a software DCBX client, enable data 
  center bridging on the Ethernet interface using the following 
  commands:
  
  # dcbtool sc ethX dcb on
  
  Then, enable FCoE on the Ethernet interface by running:
  
  # dcbtool sc ethX app:fcoe e:1
  
  Note:
  These commands will only work if the dcbd settings for the 
  Ethernet interface were not changed.
  
  5. Load the FCoE device now using:
  
  # ifconfig ethX up
  
  6. Start FCoE using
  
  # service fcoe start
  
  The FCoE device should appear shortly, assuming all other 
  settings on the fabric are correct. To view configured FCoE 
  devices, run:
  
  #fcoeadm -i
  
After correctly configuring the Ethernet interface to use FCoE, 
Red Hat recommends that you set FCoE and lldpad to run at startup. 
To do so, use chkconfig, as in:

# chkconfig lldpad on
# chkconfig fcoe on

Note:
Using systemctl stop fcoe.service will stop the daemon but will 
not deconfigure FCoE interfaces. To do so, a superuser will need 
to use the "systemctl -s SIGHUP kill fcoe.service" command.
