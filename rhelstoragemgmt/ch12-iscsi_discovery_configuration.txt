RHEL 7 Online Storage Management

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important Warning
Online storage reconfiguration must be done carefully. System failures
or interruptions during the process can lead to unexpected results. Red
Hat advises that you reduce system load to the maximum extent possible
during the change operations. This will reduce the chance of I/O errors,
out-of-memory errors, or similar errors occurring in the midst of a
configuration change. The following sections provide more specific
guidelines regarding this.

In addition, Red Hat recommends that you back up all data before
reconfiguring online storage.

12 ISCSI DISCOVERY CONFIGURATION

The default iSCSI configuration file is /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf. 
This file contains iSCSI settings used by iscsid and iscsiadm.

During target discovery, the iscsiadm tool uses the settings in 
/etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf to create two types of records:
  1. Node records in /var/lib/iscsi/nodes
  When logging into a target, iscsiadm uses the settings in this 
  file.

  2. Discovery records in /var/lib/iscsi/discovery_type
  When performing discovery to the same destination, iscsiadm uses 
  the settings in this file.

Before using different settings for discovery, delete the current 
discovery records (i.e. /var/lib/iscsi/discovery_type) first. 
To do this, use the following command:

# iscsiadm -m discovery -t discovery_type -p target_IP:port -o delete 
Note:
The target_IP and port variables refer to the IP address and port 
combination of a target/portal, respectively.
Here, discovery_type can be either sendtargets, isns, or fw.
For details on different types of discovery, refer to the 
DISCOVERY TYPES section of man iscsiadm.
There are two ways to reconfigure discovery record settings:

Edit the /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf file directly prior to performing 
a discovery. Discovery settings use the prefix discovery; 
to view them, run:

# iscsiadm -m discovery -t discovery_type -p target_IP:port

Alternatively, iscsiadm can also be used to directly change 
discovery record settings, as in:

# iscsiadm -m discovery -t discovery_type -p target_IP:port -o update -n setting -v %value

Refer to man iscsiadm for more information on available settings 
and valid values for each.

After configuring discovery settings, any subsequent attempts to 
discover new targets will use the new settings. Refer to ch14, 
“Scanning iSCSI Interconnects” for details on how to scan 
for new iSCSI targets.

For more information on configuring iSCSI target discovery, refer 
to the man pages of iscsiadm and iscsid. The /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf 
file also contains examples on proper configuration syntax.
