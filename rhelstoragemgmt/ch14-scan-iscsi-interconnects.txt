RHEL 7 Online Storage Management

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important Warning
Online storage reconfiguration must be done carefully. System failures
or interruptions during the process can lead to unexpected results. Red
Hat advises that you reduce system load to the maximum extent possible
during the change operations. This will reduce the chance of I/O errors,
out-of-memory errors, or similar errors occurring in the midst of a
configuration change. The following sections provide more specific
guidelines regarding this.

In addition, Red Hat recommends that you back up all data before
reconfiguring online storage.

14. Scan ISCSI interconnects

For iSCSI, if the targets send an iSCSI async event indicating new 
storage is added, then the scan is done automatically.

However, if the targets do not send an iSCSI async event, you need 
to manually scan them using the iscsiadm utility. Before doing so, 
however, you need to first retrieve the proper --targetname and 
the --portal values. If your device model supports only a single 
logical unit and portal per target, use iscsiadm to issue a sendtargets 
command to the host, as in:

# iscsiadm -m discovery -t sendtargets -p target_IP:port
[5]

The output will appear in the following format:
target_IP:port,target_portal_group_tag proper_target_name


Using iscsiadm to issue a sendtargets command

For example, on a target with a proper_target_name of 
iqn.1992-08.com.netapp:sn.33615311 and a target_IP:port of 
10.15.85.19:3260, the output may appear as:

10.15.84.19:3260,2 iqn.1992-08.com.netapp:sn.33615311
10.15.85.19:3260,3 iqn.1992-08.com.netapp:sn.33615311

In this example, the target has two portals, each using target_ip:ports 
of 10.15.84.19:3260 and 10.15.85.19:3260.

To see which iface configuration will be used for each session, 
add the -P 1 option. This option will print also session 
information in tree format, as in:

    Target: proper_target_name
        Portal: target_IP:port,target_portal_group_tag
           Iface Name: iface_name


View iface configuration

For example, with "iscsiadm -m discovery -t sendtargets -p 10.15.85.19:3260 -P 1", 
the output may appear as:

Target: iqn.1992-08.com.netapp:sn.33615311
    Portal: 10.15.84.19:3260,2
       Iface Name: iface2
    Portal: 10.15.85.19:3260,3
       Iface Name: iface2

This means that the target iqn.1992-08.com.netapp:sn.33615311 will 
use iface2 as its iface configuration.

With some device models a single target may have multiple logical 
units and portals. In this case, issue a sendtargets command to 
the host first to find new portals on the target. Then, rescan the 
existing sessions using:

# iscsiadm -m session --rescan

You can also rescan a specific session by specifying the session's SID 
value, as in:

# iscsiadm -m session -r SID --rescan

For information on how to retrieve a session's SID value, refer 
to ch6.1, “iSCSI API”.

If your device supports multiple targets, you will need to issue 
a sendtargets command to the hosts to find new portals for each 
target. Rescan existing sessions to discover new logical units 
on existing sessions using the --rescan option.

IMPORTANT
  1. The sendtargets command used to retrieve --targetname and --portal 
  values overwrites the contents of the 
  /var/lib/iscsi/nodes database. This database will then be repopulated 
  using the settings in /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf. However, this will 
  not occur if a session is currently logged in and in use.

  2. To safely add new targets/portals or delete old ones, use the 
  -o new or -o delete options, respectively. For example, to add new 
  targets/portals without overwriting /var/lib/iscsi/nodes, use 
  the following command:

  iscsiadm -m discovery -t st -p target_IP -o new
  
  3. To delete /var/lib/iscsi/nodes entries that the target did not 
  display during discovery, use:
  
  iscsiadm -m discovery -t st -p target_IP -o delete
  
  4. You can also perform both tasks simultaneously, as in:
  iscsiadm -m discovery -t st -p target_IP -o delete -o new
  
The sendtargets command will yield the following output:

ip:port,target_portal_group_tag proper_target_name


Output of the sendtargets command

For example, given a device with a single target, logical unit, and 
portal, with equallogic-iscsi1 as your target_name, the output 
should appear similar to the following:

10.16.41.155:3260,0 iqn.2001-05.com.equallogic:6-8a0900-ac3fe0101-63aff113e344a4a2-dl585-03-1

Note that proper_target_name and ip:port,target_portal_group_tag 
are identical to the values of the same name in ch6.1, “iSCSI 
API”.

At this point, you now have the proper --targetname and --portal 
values needed to manually scan for iSCSI devices. To do so, run 
the following command:

# iscsiadm --mode node --targetname proper_target_name --portal ip:port,target_portal_group_tag \ --login 


Full iscsiadm command

Using our previous example (where proper_target_name is 
equallogic-iscsi1), the full command would be:

# iscsiadm --mode node --targetname  \ iqn.2001-05.com.equallogic:6-8a0900-ac3fe0101-
63aff113e344a4a2-dl585-03-1 	\ --portal 10.16.41.155:3260,0 --login
