RHEL 7 Online Storage Management

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important Warning
Online storage reconfiguration must be done carefully. System failures
or interruptions during the process can lead to unexpected results. Red
Hat advises that you reduce system load to the maximum extent possible
during the change operations. This will reduce the chance of I/O errors,
out-of-memory errors, or similar errors occurring in the midst of a
configuration change. The following sections provide more specific
guidelines regarding this.

In addition, Red Hat recommends that you back up all data before
reconfiguring online storage.

19. CONTROLLING THE SCSI COMMAND TIMER AND DEVICE STATUS

The Linux SCSI layer sets a timer on each command. When this timer 
expires, the SCSI layer will quiesce the host bus adapter (HBA) and 
wait for all outstanding commands to either time out or complete. 
Afterwards, the SCSI layer will activate the driver's error handler.

When the error handler is triggered, it attempts the following 
operations in order (until one successfully executes):

  1. Abort the command.
  2. Reset the device.
  3. Reset the bus.
  4. Reset the host.
  
If all of these operations fail, the device will be set to the 
offline state. When this occurs, all I/O to that device will be 
failed, until the problem is corrected and the user sets the 
device to running.

The process is different, however, if a device uses the Fibre 
Channel protocol and the rport is blocked. In such cases, the 
drivers wait for several seconds for the rport to become online 
again before activating the error handler. This prevents devices 
from becoming offline due to temporary transport problems.

Device States

To display the state of a device, use:

$ cat /sys/block/device-name/device/state

To set a device to running state, use:

$ echo running > /sys/block/device-name/device/state

Command Timer

To control the command timer, you can write to 
/sys/block/device-name/device/timeout. To do so, run:

echo value /sys/block/device-name/device/timeout

Here, value is the timeout value (in seconds) you want to 
implement.
