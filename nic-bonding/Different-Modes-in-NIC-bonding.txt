Different Modes used in bonding.conf file .

balance-rr or 0 — round-robin mode for fault tolerance and load balancing.
active-backup or 1 — Sets active-backup mode for fault tolerance.
balance-xor or 2 — Sets an XOR (exclusive-or) mode for fault tolerance and load balancing.
broadcast or 3 — Sets a broadcast mode for fault tolerance. All transmissions are sent on all slave interfaces.
802.3ad or 4 — Sets an IEEE 802.3ad dynamic link aggregation mode. Creates aggregation groups that share the same speed & duplex settings.
balance-tlb or 5 — Sets a Transmit Load Balancing (TLB) mode for fault tolerance & load balancing.
